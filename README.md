# Analysis of Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data

This document explains in simple terms how we processed and analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data from mouse embryonic forelimb samples.

## Data Preparation

We began with raw sequencing data from mouse embryonic forelimbs at two stages of development (days 10.5 and 11.5), comparing normal (wild-type) and gene-knockout samples. Here's what we did:

1. **Created a reference map**: We prepared a customized mouse genome reference using the standard mouse genome (mm10) with annotations from GENCODE. This gave us a foundation to accurately map our sequencing reads.

2. **Processed raw data**: We used Cell Ranger software to align the raw sequencing data to our reference genome and count the number of RNA molecules for each gene in each cell.

3. **Special processing for RNA velocity**: We set up a specialized workflow to track RNA splicing, which helps us understand how gene expression changes over time. This involved creating a reference that includes both spliced and unspliced transcripts.

## Quality Control

Once we had our basic data, we cleaned it up to ensure accurate analysis:

1. **Filtered out low-quality cells**: We removed cells with:
  - Fewer than 200 genes (likely empty droplets)
  - More than 5% mitochondrial genes (likely dying cells)
  - More than 6,000 genes (likely multiple cells captured together)

2. **Detected and removed doublets**: We used software called Scrublet to identify and remove cases where two cells were accidentally captured together.

3. **Normalized the data**: We adjusted the data so that differences in sequencing depth between cells wouldn't affect our comparisons.

## Analysis Techniques

With clean data in hand, we performed multiple analyses:

1. **Dimensionality reduction**: We used PCA, UMAP, and t-SNE techniques to visualize the high-dimensional data in 2D space, making patterns easier to see.

2. **Cell clustering**: We used the Leiden algorithm to group similar cells together, helping us identify different cell types.

3. **Differential expression**: We identified genes that were expressed differently between:
  - Different cell clusters
  - Wild-type vs. knockout samples

4. **Cluster composition analysis**: We statistically compared how cell types were distributed between wild-type and knockout samples.

5. **RNA velocity analysis**: We examined the balance between newly-made (unspliced) and mature (spliced) RNA to predict the future state of cells, helping us understand developmental trajectories.

## Visualization and Integration

Finally, we created various visualizations to understand the data:

1. **UMAP plots**: Showed how cells group together based on their gene expression profiles.

2. **Stream plots**: Visualized the direction of cellular development using RNA velocity vectors.

3. **Phase portraits**: Examined the splicing dynamics of specific genes.

4. **Stacked bar plots**: Compared the distribution of cell types across different conditions.

We also integrated data from all four samples (two time points Ã— two conditions) to compare cellular dynamics across development and between wild-type and knockout samples.

All analyses were performed using Python with specialized bioinformatics packages including Scanpy, scVelo, and others.
